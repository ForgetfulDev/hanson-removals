          <p class="mt-6">
            The Hanson name has been associated with the Transport and Furniture Removals Industry in Otago for many years, and it was this long history and good old fashioned service which encouraged the present owner Richard to purchase the furniture removals division from the Hanson Family in June 2009.
            <br />
            <br />They have continued to grow and develop from these foundations with Richard's 35+ years in furniture removals as a trainer and manager. Combined with a solid team of experienced staff will take Hanson Removals Dunedin into the future which is becoming increasingly based on service and value for money.
